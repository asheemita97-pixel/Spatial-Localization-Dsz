## Overview
This model solves the coupled Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for metabolic intermediates using the Forward Time Centered Space (FTCS) finite difference method. It simulates the diffusion and reaction kinetics as well as estimates a measure of product expelled due to spatially localized Dsz enzymes (DszA, DszB, DszC) inside a bacterial cell.
